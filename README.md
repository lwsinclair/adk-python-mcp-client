## 🧠 Core Concepts

### ADK - Agent Development Kit

**Agent Development Kit (ADK)** is an open-source, code-first Python toolkit for building, evaluating, and deploying intelligent AI agents. ADK enables developers to create agentic workflows — from simple single-agent tasks to complex multi-agent orchestration — all within a modular and extensible framework.

### Agents in ADK

An **Agent** is an autonomous, self-contained execution unit designed to achieve specific goals. Agents can:
1. Perform tasks
2. Interact with users
3. Leverage external tools
4. Collaborate with other agents to complete complex workflows

#### Core Agent Categories

ADK offers three primary agent types:

* **LLM Agents** (e.g., LlmAgent, Agent):
  * Use LLMs to understand, reason, plan, and act
  * Ideal for dynamic, language-driven tasks

* **Workflow Agents** (e.g., SequentialAgent, ParallelAgent, LoopAgent):
  * Orchestrate other agents in predictable patterns
  * Don't rely on an LLM for flow control
  * Best for structured, repeatable processes

* **Custom Agents**:
  * Built by extending BaseAgent
  * Enable custom logic, specialized workflows, or unique tool integrations
  * Perfect for advanced, tailor-made solutions

In this project, we're using **LLM Agents** with **MCPTools**.

### Tools in ADK

A **Tool** represents a specific capability granted to an AI agent, allowing it to perform actions and interact with the external world beyond basic text generation and reasoning. A tool is usually a modular code component — such as a Python function, class method, or even another agent — designed to carry out a defined task.

#### How Agents Use Tools

Agents dynamically leverage tools through **function-calling mechanisms**, where the LLM:
1. Reasons over context
2. Selects and invokes the appropriate tool with generated inputs
3. Observes the result
4. Integrates the output into its next action or response

#### Tool Types in ADK

ADK supports several types of tools:

1. **Function Tools**: Custom tools built specifically for your application's unique logic
   * **Functions/Methods**: Standard synchronous Python functions or class methods
   * **Agents-as-Tools**: Specialized agents as callable tools within a parent agent
   * **Long-Running Function Tools**: Tools for asynchronous or time-intensive operations

2. **Built-in Tools**: Predefined tools included in the framework (web search, code execution, RAG)

3. **Third-Party Tools**: Integrations from popular ecosystems like LangChain or CrewAI

### MCP Client Integration

In this project, ADK serves as an MCP Client that connects to an MCP Server (`mcp-flight-search`). This connection allows the ADK agent to discover and use tools exposed by the MCP server to search for flights.

## 🛠️ Implementation Steps

### Prerequisites

1. **Python 3.8+** installed
2. Google **Gemini** Generative AI access via API key
3. A valid **SerpAPI key** (used to fetch live flight data)

### Step 1: Setup Environment

```bash
# Setup virtual environment (Mac or Unix)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install google-adk  # Agent Development Kit
pip install mcp-flight-search  # MCP server 
pip install google-generativeai python-dotenv  # GenAI Python SDK
```

**Set Environment variables:**
```bash
# Note: ADK uses GOOGLE_API_KEY instead of GEMINI_API_KEY
export GOOGLE_API_KEY="your-google-api-key"
export SERP_API_KEY="your-serpapi-key"
```

### Step 2: Install MCP Server

To enable Gemini to interact with real-world APIs, we use an MCP-compliant server. For this project, we use **mcp-flight-search** — a lightweight MCP Server built using FastMCP which exposes a tool that searches real-time flight data using SerpAPI.

Verify that the MCP server is properly installed:
```bash
pip show mcp-flight-search
```

### Step 3: Connecting to MCP Server

```python
# --- Step 1: Get tools from MCP server ---
async def get_tools_async():
    """Gets tools from the Flight Search MCP Server."""
    print("Attempting to connect to MCP Flight Search server...")
    server_params = StdioServerParameters(
        command="mcp-flight-search",
        args=["--connection_type", "stdio"],
        env={"SERP_API_KEY": os.getenv("SERP_API_KEY")},
    )
    
    tools, exit_stack = await MCPToolset.from_server(
        connection_params=server_params
    )
    print("MCP Toolset created successfully.")
    return tools, exit_stack
```

### Step 4: Agent Creation

```python
# --- Step 2: Define ADK Agent Creation ---
async def get_agent_async():
    """Creates an ADK Agent equipped with tools from the MCP Server."""
    tools, exit_stack = await get_tools_async()
    print(f"Fetched {len(tools)} tools from MCP server.")
    
    # Create the LlmAgent
    root_agent = LlmAgent(
        model=os.getenv("GEMINI_MODEL", "gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25"),
        name='flight_search_assistant',
        instruction='Help user to search for flights using available tools based on prompt. If return date not specified, use an empty string for one-way trips.',
        tools=tools,
    )
    
    return root_agent, exit_stack
```

### Step 5: Integration and Session Management

```python
async def async_main():
    # Create services
    session_service = InMemorySessionService()
  
    # Create a session
    session = session_service.create_session(
        state={}, app_name='flight_search_app', user_id='user_flights'
    )
  
    # Define the user prompt
    query = "Find flights from Atlanta to Las Vegas 2025-05-05"
    print(f"User Query: '{query}'")
    
    # Format input as types.Content
    content = types.Content(role='user', parts=[types.Part(text=query)])
  
    # Get agent and exit_stack
    root_agent, exit_stack = await get_agent_async()
  
    # Create Runner
    runner = Runner(
        app_name='flight_search_app',
        agent=root_agent,
        session_service=session_service,
    )
```

### Step 6: Execution

```python
    print("Running agent...")
    events_async = runner.run_async(
        session_id=session.id,
        user_id=session.user_id,
        new_message=content
    )
  
    # Process events
    async for event in events_async:
        print(f"Event received: {event}")
  
    # Always clean up resources
    print("Closing MCP server connection...")
    await exit_stack.aclose()
    print("Cleanup complete.")
```

### Step 7: Demo

Example user query:
```
"Find flights from Atlanta to Las Vegas 2025-05-05"
```

## 🔄 Key Considerations for Integration

1. **MCP vs. ADK**
   * **MCP** is an open protocol that standardizes how AI models interact with external tools and data sources
   * **ADK** is a Python-based framework for building and deploying AI agents
   * **MCPToolset** bridges MCP and ADK by enabling ADK agents to consume tools exposed by MCP servers

2. **Tool Types and Integration**
   * **ADK Tools**: Python objects designed for direct use within ADK agents
   * **MCP Tools**: Capabilities exposed by MCP servers, adapted by MCPToolset for use within ADK agents
   * **Third-Party Tools**: Libraries like LangChain and CrewAI offer tools that can be integrated

3. **Asynchronous Architecture**
   * Both ADK and the MCP Python library are built on Python's asyncio framework
   * Tool implementations and server handlers should be asynchronous (async def) to ensure non-blocking operations

4. **Stateful Sessions in MCP**
   * MCP establishes persistent, stateful connections between clients and servers
   * This statefulness allows for context retention across interactions but requires careful session management

5. **Deployment Considerations**
   * The persistent nature of MCP connections can pose challenges for scaling and deployment
   * Infrastructure considerations include load balancing and session affinity

6. **Managing MCP Connections in ADK**
   * MCPToolset manages the lifecycle of MCP connections within ADK
   * Using an exit_stack ensures connections are properly terminated when execution completes

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

1. **API Key Issues**: 
   - ADK expects `GOOGLE_API_KEY` instead of `GEMINI_API_KEY`
   - If you encounter `ValueError: Missing key inputs argument!`, check that you're using the correct environment variable
   - Error message: `ValueError: Missing key inputs argument! To use the Google AI API, provide (api_key) arguments. To use the Google Cloud API, provide (vertexai, project & location) arguments.`

2. **Rate Limiting**:
   - You may encounter 429 rate-limit errors: `google.genai.errors.ClientError: 429 RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED`
   - Consider implementing retries with exponential backoff

3. **MCP Connection Issues**:
   - Ensure the MCP server is properly installed and accessible
   - Check that your SerpAPI key is correctly configured

4. **Internal Server Errors**:
   - You may occasionally see 500 internal server errors from the Gemini API
   - These can often be resolved by retrying the request after a short delay
